		Brute Force vs. Optimization
		</a>
	</h2>
	<p>
		We can say that optimization is one step further than the 
		brute-force method of problem solving. However, that does not 
		mean that optimization is always the best answer. In this article,
		we will discuss brute force, optimization, time complexity, and 
		space complexity and compare these methods. We will also discuss 
		how to bridge the gap between brute force and optimization. 
		If you are a software developer and 
		are puzzled about both of these methods, this article is for you.
